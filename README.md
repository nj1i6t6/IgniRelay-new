When cell towers fall and the internet goes dark, phones still relay messages, SOS calls and supply matches to each other — hop by hop.

> ⚠️ **Fork-baseline notice** — This README describes the **legacy resource-matching app**
> (supply matching / chat / medical card) as inherited at the fork point. The **rebuild
> direction** — a lean field-node / SOS / last-footprint relay per the whitepaper — lives in
> [`docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md`](docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md). For current intent, trust the plan over this README.

> **TL;DR** — IgniRelay is an offline-first, event-sourced disaster-response mobile app.
> When cellular and internet are down, nearby phones form a **Bluetooth-LE mesh** that signs,
> stores, relays and replays emergency events (SOS / hazards / supply matching / geofenced chat)
> across devices — with **no servers, no internet, no accounts**. Built with Flutter + native BLE
> (Android Nordic BLE, iOS CoreBluetooth), backed by a SQLite event log + projection tables,
> Ed25519 signatures and a Hybrid Logical Clock.

## What this is

The heart of IgniRelay is **not the UI**. It is the problem of *"how, with no network, do you spread
events safely between phones and persist them locally as queryable state?"*

It packs the following into a single mobile product:

- 📍 **Offline maps & local POI lookup** — bundled Taiwan vector maps; locate yourself and see hazard markers even fully offline.
- 📡 **BLE-mesh broadcast / GATT sync / store-and-forward relay** — every phone is a node; messages propagate hop by hop.
- 🆘 **SOS / supply / hazard events** — each one Ed25519-signed, persisted, projected and replayable.
- 🤝 **Two-way supply ↔ demand matching** — negotiation state machine, navigation, physical-handoff handshake.
- 💬 **Geofenced chat rooms** — auto-join by country / county / township / village.
- 🩺 **Medical card & Health Connect import** — carry critical medical info into an SOS.

> Treating this as "just a Flutter app" badly underestimates it. More precisely: the UI is only the
> outermost shell — **the SQLite projection is the core state surface, Ed25519 + HLC are the
> consistency and trust foundation, and the native BLE bridge is what makes the whole product
> possible at all.**

## Why it is designed this way

A disaster scene assumes **no network, no server, and no trust in unknown nodes**. So the entire
backbone is event-driven and offline-first:

```
Create event locally
  → Sign with Ed25519
    → Write to Event_Logs (raw event-sourcing store)
      → Project into business tables (Materials_State / Requests_State / Hazards_State …)
        → Enqueue into the BLE-mesh send queue (priority triage)
          → Nearby devices receive over GATT / advertising
            → Verify sig · dedup · HLC merge · geofence routing decision
              → Persist again + project
                → UI re-queries the DB on a stream refresh signal and shows the latest state
```

The UI **never renders directly from raw protobuf events** — it queries projection tables. The event
log keeps the raw mesh events for provenance and as a second line of dedup defense.

## Platform support

| Platform | Requirements | Mesh role |
|---|---|---|
| **Android** | minSdk 26 / targetSdk 35 / compileSdk 36 | Nordic BLE central + foreground GATT server |
| **iOS** | iOS 13+, CocoaPods | CoreBluetooth central / peripheral (background BLE) |

> ⚠️ BLE is **not optional here — it is the core feature**. A physical device with Bluetooth LE is
> required; emulators cannot validate mesh behavior.

## Tech stack

| Area | Used |
|---|---|
| App framework | Flutter 3.x / Dart ≥ 3.2 |
| State management | `provider` + singleton services + SQLite projection + event streams + local `ChangeNotifier` |
| Local storage | `sqflite` (schema v8, event log + projection tables), `flutter_secure_storage`, `shared_preferences` |
| Crypto / identity | Ed25519 (`cryptography`), `crypto`; keys in secure storage, identity levels 0–3 |
| Consistency / time | Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC); release builds inject `BUILD_TIMESTAMP` as a drift-protection baseline |
| Transport | Native BLE (Android Nordic BLE / iOS CoreBluetooth) over MethodChannel / EventChannel |
| Wire format | Protocol Buffers (`protos/mesh_protocol.proto`) |
| Maps | Offline MBTiles vector maps (`flutter_map` + `vector_map_tiles`), native `sqlite3` |
| Localization | Traditional Chinese / English (`app_zh.arb` / `app_en.arb`) |

## Project structure (monorepo)

The repo root is the governance entrypoint; the Flutter app lives in `ignirelay_app/`.

### Architecture layers

The code keeps a clear four-layer separation, with import boundaries enforced by tooling:

1. **UI layer** `lib/ui/**` — screens, widgets, controller binding.
2. **Application / Service layer** `lib/app/services/**`, `lib/app/controllers/**` — negotiation state machine, queries, flow control.
3. **Communication / Mesh layer** `lib/app/mesh/**`, `lib/platform/**` — signing, send/receive, verification, routing, persistence.
4. **Native layer** `android/`, `ios/` — MethodChannel / EventChannel, BLE central / peripheral.

> The full layer rules (forbidden imports, facade access pattern, 500-line cap, etc.) live in
> [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and are enforced by `dart run tool/check_layers.dart --strict`.

## Development requirements

- Flutter 3.x, Dart ≥ 3.2.0
- Android Studio Ladybug+, Android SDK (minSdk 26 / targetSdk 35 / compileSdk 36)
- Xcode 15+ (iOS)

## Quick start

```bash
cd ignirelay_app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on a connected physical device (BLE required)
flutter run
```

### iOS extra step

```bash
cd ignirelay_app/ios
pod install   # requires Flutter/Generated.xcconfig to exist first
```

### Android release example

HLC drift protection needs a build timestamp injected into release builds:

```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=BUILD_TIMESTAMP=1777334400000
```

> Without `android/key.properties`, release builds fall back to debug signing.

## Testing & quality checks

```bash
cd ignirelay_app

# All tests
flutter test

# Scoped tests
flutter test test/mesh/
flutter test test/event/
flutter test test/services/

# Architecture import-boundary check
dart run tool/check_layers.dart --strict
```

Tests fall into three tiers: pure Dart, `sqflite_ffi` in-memory DB, and integration tests that need
geodata or a real device. See `ignirelay_app/test/TEST_INDEX.md` for the overview.

## Deeper documentation

This README is the entrypoint. For the **full technical anatomy** (startup sequence, data tables,
the mesh receive pipeline, routing strategy, native integration, known gaps & risks, and a suggested
reading order), see:

📖 **[`ignirelay_app/README.md`](ignirelay_app/README.md)**

## Project status

`pubspec.yaml` version `0.2.5+31`, **active development**. Some protocol events (e.g.
`QUARANTINE_VOTE`, `FIRE_ALARM_RF`) are currently reserved / no-op on the receive side, and the
medical summary is not yet wired into the SOS wire payload. When reading the proto, do not assume
every message is fully connected to the UI — see "Known gaps & risks" in the technical README.
