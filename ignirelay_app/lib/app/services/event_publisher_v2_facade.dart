// EventPublisherV2Facade — Dart-side broadcast facade for the v0.3
// EventEnvelope v2 send path (Stage 0c wave 3E / 3E-r2 / 3E-r3 partial).
//
// SCOPE NOTE — this facade is the Dart half of the v0.3 publish path.
// Cross-platform Stage 0c (§3.4 of the roadmap) requires all three
// lanes (0c1/0c2/0c3) green; the iOS native side is still in port
// (Swift Chunker + CanonicalEncoderV2 + debug hooks). 3E-r3 closes the
// Dart + Android-native gaps the QA review surfaced; iOS parity is a
// separate follow-up wave. Until iOS lands, the most we can claim is
// "Android-pair 0d-preflight ready" — not "Stage 0c complete".
//
// Spec: docs/specs/envelope_v2_spec_2026-05-13.md + native_transport_v1.md.
//
// PURPOSE
//
// Stage 0c waves 3A-3D landed the per-peer v2 pipeline (MessagePublisherV2,
// BleV2Bridge.sendEnvelope). The 0d real-device gate (see brief §3.5)
// requires that the core event types it tests — SOS_RED, HAZARD_MARKER,
// STATUS_UPDATE (and PRESENCE) — actually flow through that v2 pipeline,
// not through the legacy v0.2 EventPublisher → EventManager → raw
// MeshEvent path. (CHAT_MESSAGE was a core type too until A6/OD-6 retired it.)
//
// This facade is the migration-window adapter: app-layer callers
// (EventPublisher dual-write, StatusController, HazardOverlay, ChatService)
// hold a `EventPublisherV2Facade` instead of (or in addition to) the
// legacy `EventPublisher`. The facade builds the envelope, iterates the
// registry's active peers, and dispatches via `BleV2Bridge.sendEnvelope`
// to each. Outcomes are aggregated into a `BroadcastOutcome` so callers
// see one accept/reject summary per call instead of per-peer noise.
//
// LIFECYCLE (3E-r2 fix — important)
//
// In wave 3E-r1 the facade was constructed inside the async `_startV2Bridge()`
// path, which meant the Provider for it was nullable AND value-based. UI
// reading from Provider almost always saw `null` because the async init
// finishes AFTER the first `build()` and Provider does not rebuild when
// a module-level variable mutates.
//
// 3E-r2 fix: the facade is now constructed EAGERLY at app startup with
// just the registry. The bridge is attached later via [attachBridge].
// Sends issued BEFORE the bridge arrives are recorded into an in-memory
// pending queue and replayed automatically once the bridge attaches AND
// a peer reaches `isReadyForTraffic`. Provider exposes a non-null facade
// from the first frame.
//
// LOCAL QUEUE (3E-r2 fix)
//
// When `_broadcast` finds zero active peers, it now enqueues the publish
// request into an in-memory pending queue (bounded; oldest is dropped at
// cap) and returns `BroadcastOutcome.queued()`. The queue is drained on
// `PeerCapabilityRegistry.changes` whenever any peer becomes
// `isReadyForTraffic`. Each queued entry retains its ORIGINAL HLC
// timestamp pair so spec §10.2 LWW semantics are preserved across the
// queue→peer window.
//
// PERSISTENCE (Stage 0c wave 3F + 3F-r3 — Outbox_V2):
//   The pending queue is mirrored to the `Outbox_V2` SQLite table
//   (schema v11, see `database_helper.dart` `_createOutboxV2Table`).
//   Behavior:
//     • The envelope_id (16-byte UUIDv7) is pre-allocated AT
//       `_broadcast()` time — BEFORE the queue-vs-immediate-send branch
//       and BEFORE disk write. Both paths use the same id, so the in-
//       memory `_PendingPublish` and its Outbox_V2 row agree, and a
//       restart-driven re-drain emits the SAME envelope_id the first
//       attempt did. This is what makes re-delivery idempotent —
//       receiver-side dedup on `Envelopes_V2.envelope_id` PK +
//       `Tombstones_V2` drops the duplicate.
//     • Wave 3F-r3 fix — earlier 3F implementation let
//       `MessagePublisherV2.send()` mint a fresh UUIDv7 every drain,
//       defeating receiver dedup for non-LWW events (SOS_RED,
//       HAZARD_MARKER) and producing duplicates on the receiver after a
//       restart-mid-drain. Now closed.
//     • On facade construction (with a non-null `db:` arg) hydration
//       reads up to `kMaxPendingEntries` rows ordered by `id ASC`
//       (= FIFO) and rebuilds the in-memory queue, restoring each
//       row's persisted envelope_id. Already-expired or
//       past-`kPendingEntryMaxAge` rows are pruned during hydration.
//     • Every `_enqueue` mirrors to disk (fire-and-forget — disk failure
//       degrades to pre-3F in-memory behavior, never blocks publish).
//     • Every successful drain delivery, TTL expiry, and cap-eviction
//       deletes the row.
//     • The per-entry `deliveredTo` Set is intentionally NOT persisted.
//       After a restart we may re-deliver to peers we already reached;
//       receiver-side dedup on the (now-stable) envelope_id makes that
//       idempotent. A junction table per peer would be cleaner but is
//       overkill for wave 3F.
//   Pass `db: null` (the default) in tests / in-memory mode to opt out.
//
// MIGRATION STATUS (Stage 0c wave 3E — KEEP THIS LIST CURRENT)
//
//   v2 routes today (eligible for 0d testing):
//     - PROTOCOL_HELLO  (already shipped per wave 3A; ProtocolHelloService)
//     - SOS_RED / SOS_YELLOW STATUS_UPDATE  (this facade, publishSosStatus)
//     - HAZARD_MARKER                       (this facade, publishHazardMarker)
//     - STATUS_UPDATE (non-SOS)             (this facade, publishStatusUpdate)
//     - PRESENCE                            (this facade, publishPresence)
//   (CHAT_MESSAGE retired in A6 / OD-6 — no publish path; wire number 30 is
//    reserved, see EventTypeV2.chatMessage.)
//   Dual-write entry points (legacy v0.2 + v2):
//     - EventPublisher.publishEvent              → publishStatusUpdate
//       (urgency mapped to safetyState; the facade applies the spec §5.3
//       payload-implied priority floor — SOS_RED for TRAPPED, SOS_YELLOW
//       for INJURED / urgent need, STATUS otherwise. The dispatch DOES
//       NOT branch into publishSosStatus from the legacy side; the floor
//       lives inside publishStatusUpdate so all callers go through ONE
//       priority-derivation path. publishSosStatus is now a thin
//       priority-hinted wrapper for direct callers that already know.)
//     - EventPublisher.publishHazard             → publishHazardMarker
//
//   Still on legacy path only (NOT 0d-eligible; legacy EventPublisher → v0.2):
//     - SUPPLY_REQUEST / SUPPLY_OFFER       (existing match/supply flow)
//     - MATCH_INTENT / NEGOTIATION          (existing match flow)
//     - RELAY_TO_CONTACT                    (existing relay flow)
//     - SHELTER_STATUS                      (UI surface not yet built)
//     - OFFICIAL_ALERT_CAP / SUMMARY        (no in-app authoring surface)
//     - BATTERY_STATUS / HEARTBEAT          (not user-facing)
//     - TRACE_PING / TRACE_ACK              (dev-mode only)
//
// 0d gate test runner MUST publish via this facade for the four core
// types; tests touching the still-on-legacy list MUST be flagged as
// "legacy path" so QA does not misread a v0.2 success as v0.3 acceptance.
//
// ARCHITECTURE NOTE — why a facade, not direct UI access to BleV2Bridge:
//   - UI layer per CLAUDE.md must not import `lib/app/mesh/**` or
//     `lib/app/proto/**`. The facade lives in `lib/app/services/` and
//     exposes only primitive types (int / Uint8List / String). UI calls
//     `context.read<EventPublisherV2Facade>().publishSos(...)` and gets a
//     `BroadcastOutcome` back. No protobuf types leak into UI.
//   - BleV2Bridge is per-peer; the facade is broadcast. Mixing the two
//     concerns in one class would force UI to know about peer discovery
//     state, which is the BLE layer's job.
